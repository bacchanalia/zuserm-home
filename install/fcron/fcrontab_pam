# The PAM configuration file for fcrontab

# WARNING : you cannot use every modules here, as some
#           (such as pam_unix_acct.so) require the program to be run
#           by root or suid root, and fcrontab is *not* suid root.

# By default we do not ask user for a password
# (but fcrontab can do it, if you configure it to do so)

# pam_unix.so seems to get very cross if you use it to do account
# management but didn't use it for auth.  Can't people write PAM
# modules right, for once?
